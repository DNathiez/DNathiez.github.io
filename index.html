<section class="about-me" id="about-me">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Djason Nathiez, student in 3rd year of Game Programming at Rubika Supinfogame, France. I'm a specialized Gameplay Programmer on Unity. I actually work my knowledge in Network Programming because I have a huge interess on network games and the fact that I connect people each others. </p>
    <p>My career goal is to become a Gameplay or Network Programmer on games with social aspect. This intention come with the fact that online game took a huge part of my life and make me what I'm today. I'm was a big player of MMORPG (mainly World of Warcraft and DOFUS) and that make my interest in giving opportunities to player to connect each others.</p>
    <p>Through my different projects, I developped some skills that I use now as motor of my work style and continue to work on it to improve my capacities.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="about-me-col">
            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
            <p>All my projects was driven by a huge teamwork spirit. Through communication
                and skill sharing, we worked together to able to achieved the game we
                worked on. Thanks to that I built solids skills in communication and
                teamwork, adapt easily on team communication software like Jira, Notion or
                Trello. I always try to maximise the visibility on my current work with
                my teammates, looking for feedback in order to make my code strong and
                in accordance with the request.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-me-col">
            <h3>Adaptative</h3>
            <p>Thanks for my multiple experience, I understood that a project may need
                that I learn new programming methods, languages or software every day.
                That makes me able to fastly adapt myself to a programming situation and
                learn faster. It help me to identity a problem, look for multiple solution,
                choose a way that I can consider as viable, try it to be sure that is good
                and finally polish it to make it readable, efficient and strong.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="about-me-col">
            <h3>Iterative</h3>
            <p>My opinion is that the development of a video game is never really ended.
                Sometimes, a Game Designer will come with new features ideas to test,
                a change of engine or programming architecture can happen or a lot
                of graphic change may impact the code. In that way, I always tried to
                make my code iterative and easily modular. That come with readable, independent and structured code. That really helped me on
                a lot of project which were short in production time and needed fast
                implementation of feature to test and approve them. A code will never be
                perfect but I work hard on them to make it easy to iterate on them.</p>

                <p>On this project, I was assigned as Gameplay Programmer and was in charge of the shooter controller, taking care of fluidity of the feature and adding some accessibility modules as Aim-Assit.</p>

                <p>This project was my first 3D experience, developed on Unity, but also the first time I was a full-time programmer on a project. The output of this project was to be a prototype that we had to develop in 4 months.</p>
                <p>I was assigned as a Gameplay Programmer to do the game controller, the enemy AI and all the puzzle implementation in the Haunted House, the dungeon, but I also did other secondary tasks like UI, asset integration and sound design.</p>

                <p>Discosmos is a MOBA where two teams of two players each compete by using the available rails to gain speed in order to unload power. Each team must hit a puck to score in the opponent's camp before the end of the time limit, the team with the most points wins.</p>
                <p>This project was the very first online game I created. It was developed in Unity using the Photon Engine SDK to make the network connection. It was a real production challenge because of the time given to make it: 2 months for the whole project.</p>
                <p>For this production, I took on the role of Lead Game Programmer and Network Programmer. I was in charge of managing the team of programmers and setting up the whole network infrastructure of the game. I also took care of some small tasks like integrating assets and making UI.</p>

                <p>I came on this project during the production and I mainly did code debugging, user interface programmation, level design and some short task between that like scoring system.</p>
